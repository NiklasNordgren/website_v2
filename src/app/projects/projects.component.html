        The system provide students with exams from the past three years to
        study. In order for university personnel to manage the system a full
        featured administrative interface was created.

        The thesis work involves analysis and visualization of big data,
        generated by machines in the cutting industry. The analysis was done by
        using artificial intelligence trained on sequential data to predict tool
        failure. When identifying a data sequence that could potentially lead to
        a tool failure, the machine operator is notified via a mobile
        application installed on a portable device. The data visualizations
        consist of interactive line charts and time-sorted lists of machine
        events. The interactive line diagrams are two-dimensional and show
        measurement values originating from any machine's sensors along the y
        axis and time along the x axis. The interactivity available to users in
        the line graphs is zooming, panning, and clickable data points.
